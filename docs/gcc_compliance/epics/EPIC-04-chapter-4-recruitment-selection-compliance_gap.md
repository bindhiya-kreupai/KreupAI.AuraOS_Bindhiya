# Gap Analysis: EPIC-04: Chapter 4 – Recruitment & Selection Compliance

> Source epic: [EPIC-04-chapter-4-recruitment-selection-compliance.md](./EPIC-04-chapter-4-recruitment-selection-compliance.md)

## Assessment Method

This storywise gap review compares each GCC compliance user story against the current AuraOS implementation path inventory under `apps/`, `packages/@aura/`, and `services/`. Evidence is path-based and should be treated as a triage signal, not proof that all acceptance criteria are satisfied. Planning/report documents are listed separately when they match the story.

## Summary

- Stories assessed: 16
- Partial: 16

## Epic Goal

Deliver an AuraOS recruitment module that governs the full hire lifecycle — from an approved vacancy (EPIC-03) through compliant requisitions, job descriptions, sourcing, agency control, screening, interviews, assessments, background and immigration-eligibility verification, compensation benchmarking and offer initiation — with anti-discrimination and candidate-data-privacy controls enforced at every step. The module must embed GCC nationalization-first sourcing and produce recruitment KPIs, a compliance dashboard and an audit checklist.
