## Assessment Method

This story-level gap file compares the GCC compliance story against the current AuraOS implementation path inventory under `apps/`, `packages/@aura/`, and `services/`. Evidence is path-based triage and must be verified through code review and tests before the story is marked complete.

## Story Requirement

**Labels / priority / estimate:** `user-story`, `eosb` · **Priority:** Could · **Estimate:** 2

**Description**
Surfaces the chapter's key takeaways as a configurable guidance panel and a short readiness checklist for EOSB users (use the correct country rule, confirm salary basis, apply resignation treatment, adjust unpaid leave, net social-insurance funding, get maker-checker approval, release provision on payout). Content is admin-editable, versioned and EN/AR.

**Covers:** 28.30
**Acceptance criteria count:** 4 · **Task count:** 4

## Current Status

**Status:** Likely Partial/Implemented

**Existing implementation evidence**

**Planning / prior analysis evidence**

- None found.

## Gap To Close

- confirm/add tenant-scoped schema or config; externalize country-specific rules into versioned config.

## Acceptance Criteria To Verify

- [ ] Given the EOSB module home, when opened, then a key-takeaways panel shows configurable guidance.
- [ ] Given a first-time user, then a short readiness checklist of EOSB essentials is shown.
- [ ] Given guidance content, when edited, then it is versioned and effective-dated.
- [ ] Given localisation, then guidance supports English/Arabic.

## Implementation Tasks From Backlog

- [ ] Backend: `eosb_guidance_content` table (key, body, locale, version)
- [ ] Frontend: key-takeaways panel + first-run checklist
- [ ] Rules/Config: admin-editable guidance EN/AR
- [ ] Tests: unit test for versioning and locale fallback

## Next Verification

- Review the evidence files against the acceptance criteria.
- Confirm tenant isolation, RBAC, validation, audit trail, and country-rule behavior where applicable.
- Add or run targeted unit, integration, and E2E tests before marking this story complete.
