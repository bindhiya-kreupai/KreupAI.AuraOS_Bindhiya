## Assessment Method

This story-level gap file compares the GCC compliance story against the current AuraOS implementation path inventory under `apps/`, `packages/@aura/`, and `services/`. Evidence is path-based triage and must be verified through code review and tests before the story is marked complete.

## Story Requirement

**Labels / priority / estimate:** `user-story`, `leave` · **Priority:** Should · **Estimate:** 5
**User story:** Compliance Officer, **I want** a monthly leave compliance pack and signed certificate, **so that** management certification and audit evidence are generated automatically.

**Description**
Assemble a monthly pack (KPIs, liability, registers, misuse/privacy items, open audit actions) and a configurable monthly leave compliance certificate with maker-checker sign-off and export.

**Covers:** 20.30, 20.31
**Acceptance criteria count:** 4 · **Task count:** 6

## Current Status

**Status:** Partial

**Existing implementation evidence**

## Gap To Close

- confirm/add tenant-scoped schema or config; add/wire service logic; verify evidence capture, retention, and immutable audit.

## Acceptance Criteria To Verify

- [ ] Given month-end, when the pack runs, then it compiles KPIs, liability, registers and open actions per entity/country.
- [ ] Given the certificate, when generated, then it reflects pack figures and requires sign-off (preparer ≠ approver).
- [ ] Given sign-off, when completed, then the certificate is locked, versioned and exportable (PDF).
- [ ] Given generation, when done, then it is audit-logged and archived to the document store.

## Implementation Tasks From Backlog

- [ ] Backend: pack assembler + `leave_certificate` schema
- [ ] Backend: PDF export + document-store archival
- [ ] Frontend: pack viewer + certificate sign-off screen
- [ ] Rules/Config: certificate template per country/entity
- [ ] Alerts/Workflow: month-end generation + sign-off reminder
- [ ] Tests: e2e for pack assembly, sign-off lock, export

## Next Verification

- Review the evidence files against the acceptance criteria.
- Confirm tenant isolation, RBAC, validation, audit trail, and country-rule behavior where applicable.
- Add or run targeted unit, integration, and E2E tests before marking this story complete.
