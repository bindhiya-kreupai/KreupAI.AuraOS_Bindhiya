## Assessment Method

This story-level gap file compares the GCC compliance story against the current AuraOS implementation path inventory under `apps/`, `packages/@aura/`, and `services/`. Evidence is path-based triage and must be verified through code review and tests before the story is marked complete.

## Story Requirement

**Labels / priority / estimate:** `user-story`, `analytics` · **Priority:** Should · **Estimate:** 3

**Description**
Build a WPS dashboard with on-time submission %, salary-delay incidents, file-rejection rate, reconciliation-break count, exception aging, coverage % and penalty exposure, broken down by legal entity and country with drill-down and RBAC.

**Covers:** 11.16
**Acceptance criteria count:** 4 · **Task count:** 4

## Current Status

**Status:** Partial

## Gap To Close

- confirm/add tenant-scoped schema or config; add/wire service logic; add protected API route with validation/RBAC; externalize country-specific rules into versioned config; verify query-backed dashboard/reporting.

## Acceptance Criteria To Verify

- [ ] Given the dashboard, when loaded, then on-time submission %, delay incidents, rejection rate and open exceptions show per entity/country.
- [ ] Given a KPI tile, when clicked, then it drills to the underlying files/employees/exceptions.
- [ ] Given RBAC, when a user views, then only in-scope entities are visible.
- [ ] Given a period filter, when applied, then metrics recompute for that period.

## Implementation Tasks From Backlog

- [ ] Backend: WPS KPI aggregation endpoints
- [ ] Frontend: WPS KPI dashboard with drill-down + export
- [ ] Rules/Config: KPI definitions/thresholds
- [ ] Tests: integration tests for KPI computation and RBAC scoping

## Next Verification

- Review the evidence files against the acceptance criteria.
- Confirm tenant isolation, RBAC, validation, audit trail, and country-rule behavior where applicable.
- Add or run targeted unit, integration, and E2E tests before marking this story complete.
