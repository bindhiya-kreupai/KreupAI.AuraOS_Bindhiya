## Assessment Method

This story-level gap file compares the GCC compliance story against the current AuraOS implementation path inventory under `apps/`, `packages/@aura/`, and `services/`. Evidence is path-based triage and must be verified through code review and tests before the story is marked complete.

## Story Requirement

**Labels / priority / estimate:** `user-story`, `social-insurance` · **Priority:** Could · **Estimate:** 2

**Description**
Surfaces the chapter's key takeaways as a configurable guidance panel and a short readiness checklist for new GPSSA module users (register nationals on time, declare correct account salary, reconcile before submit, handle transfers/exits, keep Emiratisation evidence). Content is admin-editable, versioned, EN/AR.

**Covers:** 14.23
**Acceptance criteria count:** 4 · **Task count:** 4

## Current Status

**Status:** Partial

**Existing implementation evidence**

- apps/web/src/app/dashboard/benefits/insurance-coverage/page.tsx
- apps/web/src/components/benefits/LifeInsuranceDashboard.tsx
- apps/web/src/app/api/v1/compliance/gosi/submissions/route.ts
- apps/web/src/components/benefits/PensionEOSBDashboard.tsx
- apps/mobile/src/screens/benefits/BenefitsHomeScreen.tsx
- apps/mobile/src/screens/benefits/ClaimDetailsScreen.tsx
- apps/mobile/src/screens/benefits/SubmitClaimScreen.tsx
- apps/mobile/src/services/benefits.service.ts

**Planning / prior analysis evidence**

- docs/implementation/API_VERSIONING_IMPLEMENTATION.md

## Gap To Close

- confirm/add tenant-scoped schema or config; add tests; externalize country-specific rules into versioned config.

## Acceptance Criteria To Verify

- [ ] Given the GPSSA module home, when opened, then a key-takeaways panel shows configurable guidance.
- [ ] Given a first-time user, then a short readiness checklist of GPSSA essentials is shown.
- [ ] Given guidance content, when edited, then it is versioned and effective-dated.
- [ ] Given localisation, then guidance supports English/Arabic.

## Implementation Tasks From Backlog

- [ ] Backend: `gpssa_guidance_content` table (key, body, locale, version)
- [ ] Frontend: key-takeaways panel + first-run checklist
- [ ] Rules/Config: admin-editable guidance EN/AR
- [ ] Tests: unit test for versioning and locale fallback

## Next Verification

- Review the evidence files against the acceptance criteria.
- Confirm tenant isolation, RBAC, validation, audit trail, and country-rule behavior where applicable.
- Add or run targeted unit, integration, and E2E tests before marking this story complete.
